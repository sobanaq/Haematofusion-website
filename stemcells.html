    <h3 class="title">The challenges and potential uses of platelets derived from pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
    </h3>

    <p>Platelets are enucleated blood cells also known as thrombocytes. They serve as part of the haemostasis cycle by
        clumping together to form a platelet ‘plug’ at the sight of injury, thus stopping the bleeding. They were
        discovered in the early 1880s by Giulio Buzzozero. He suggested that these were not like red blood cells or
        white blood cells thus forming the third element of blood. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MK cells)
        via a process known as thrombopoiesis. Megakaryocytes are formed by the myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow.
        These large cells are unique to mammals. They are produced by a complex process known as megakaryopoiesis, with
        key factors being MPL protein and TPO receptor (Sim et al., 2016). Thrombopoietin (TPO) binds to the receptor
        c-MPL which activates the JAK/STAT pathway, this stimulates the maturation of megakaryocyte (see fig.1) (Zhang
        and Zehnder, 2016). Megakaryocytes become larger in size (50-100µm) therefore unable to enter the blood vessels.
        To overcome this, the megakaryocyte protrudes projections known as proplatelets into the sinusoid pores, where
        the pressure of contents in the vessel breaks off the projections thus forming platelets. The process of how
        these become platelets are not clear.
    </p>
    <p>Circulating platelets have a lifespan of 8-10 days where they are then destroyed in the liver and spleen via
        phagocytosis (Nayak, Kulkarni and Dash, 2013). Each megakaryocyte can form ~3000 platelets during its lifetime,
        whereas in other sites this is much less. Platelets are critical blood cells; defects in platelets give rise to
        platelet disorders such as thrombocytopenia which may require platelet transfusions.
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/tpo.JPG" alt="TPO" class="center"></p>

    <p>Platelet transfusion therapy plays a crucial role in the management of patients with various conditions, which
        impede hemostasis either through lack of platelet production or clotting factors, which lead to bleeding
        complications. Since its introduction in the 1950’s countless lives have been saved. However, the availability
        of platelets relies solely on generous human donations. Ultimately as the treatment regimens get better, this
        has led to an ageing population which may require support through blood products. This has increased the need
        for platelet transfusion (see fig.2) with 67% demand coming from haematological malignant patients alone
        (Estcourt, 2014).
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/nhsbtplateletstats.JPG" alt="nhsbtplateletstats" class="center"></p>

    <p>Whatever the reason for an increase in the use of platelets transfusions, ultimately there needs to be a
        resolution for this demand. There are over 10,000 platelet donors in the UK who have donated platelets. Between
        mid-2016 to mid-2017 over 79,000 units were donated. Prior to 2013, NHSBT collected at least 80% of platelets
        using apheresis from a single donor, the thought being to reduce the risk of exposure to vCJD and Hepatitis E
        virus. However this was reconsidered as it was found that using additive solution with the addition of bacterial
        screening was much more cost effective (see table 1) (Lozano, Rivera and Vicente, 2012; Platelet Strategy –
        Phase Two, 2017: SaBTO annual report 13/14).
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/apharesis.JPG" alt="apharesis" class="center"></p>

    <p>At present, this demand is being met by changing collection methods whilst also been cost effective. However,
        with the need to satiate this increasing demand for platelets and ever increasing burden on the NHS, there is a
        need to plug this gap.
    </p>
    <p>Scientists have researched ways to obtain platelets from stem cells. Stem cell use was first established in bone
        marrow transplants in the late 1950’s, and still remains the most widely used stem cell therapy today (Henig &
        Zuckerman, 2014).
    </p>
    <p>Stem cells are undifferentiated cells which have the ability to turn into any cell in the body, thus making them
        ideal for fixing damaged cells and introducing cells where they were previously absent. Stem cells are sourced
        from fetal tissue or human embryos (known as embryonic stem cells) or adult stem cells which are located in all
        places of the body. The main sources for adult stem cells are in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, placenta,
        umbilical cord blood and epithelial tissue (Bethesda, 2016).
    </p>
    <p>There have been various controversies and ethical issues over the last 30 years concerning research on stem
        cells, mainly from embryos as it involves the destruction of embryonic cells. Religious groups have argued the
        belief that life begins at conception, therefore, destroying blastocyst would be equivalent to destroying life.
        This created various acts in the UK for regulating the use of human cells and tissues until the final
        establishment of the Human Tissue Authority in 2005, after it was found that Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool was
        retaining organs from patients without consent, and negligent attitudes toward the then legislation (Human
        Tissue Act, 2004; Human Tissue Authority, 2017). In America, stem cell research greatly slowed down from 2001 to
        2009 when then-President George W Bush limited the use of embryonic stem cell to only a few cell lines.
    </p>
    <p>In 2006 Shinya Yamanaka developed induced pluripotent stem cell technology based on the idea of reprogramming
        cells from Sir John Gurden. He found by introducing a few genes he was able to reverse mature mice cells into
        pluripotent stem cells (Nobel Prize, 2017). Subsequently, in 2009, President Barack Obama lifted the ban thus
        allowing funding for research in stem cells lines with the view of improving treatments for patients (Wolinsky,
        2009).
    </p>
    <p>This has led to research of stem cells use for a range regenerative medicine including that blood components such
        as red cells and platelets.
    </p>
    <p>One such method has been using Yamanaka’s model of induced pluripotent stem cells, by producing human platelets
        ex vivo which would meet demand exponentially but this method of production has its potential uses and
        challenges as discussed further.
    </p>
    <p>In order for cells to be safe for human transfusion, the source of the pluripotent stem cell is the most
        important factor. This needs to take into account yield reproduced (ie/ can large yield be obtained easily to
        meet demand), free from contamination and disease and universally acceptable thus taking HLA typing into
        account. Ambient conditions for platelets are vital for their storage and potential production. At present
        platelets must meet strict conditions to remain viable and sufficient for transfusion (see table 2a&b – adapted
        from Norfolk, 2013). Platelet production must also consider the environment of production by keeping it as close
        to in vitro as possible in sterile environments which is not only costly but time consuming.
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/platelets.JPG" alt="platelets" class="center"></p>

    <h2>Methods of producing efficient MK cell lines</h2>
    <p>The exact process of platelet formation is not clear, therefore scientists are using iPSCs to generate precursor
        of platelets known as megakaryocytes (MK cells) which in turn carry out megakaryopoiesis and production of
        platelets. As platelets have a short lifespan of around 10 days, scientists are trying to develop methods which
        create as many MK cells as possible. There have been various methods which differentiate iPSCs into MK cells.
    </p>
    <p>There are many challenges into creating platelets (see fig. 3), which need to be addressed in a step by step to
        make sustainable methods of safe, viable platelets for transfusion. Things to take into account include
        contamination risks, an iPSC cell line which is free from antibodies, HLA alloantibodies and bulk producing
        abilities with no Hayflick limit, whereby cells can divide only a number of time before telomeres get shorter.
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/makingplatelets.JPG" alt="makingplatelets" class="center"></p>

    <p>In 1995, scientists developed the first method to produce platelets in vitro. They took CD34+ peripheral blood
        cells and cultured them to grow megakaryocytes. It took 8-10 days to see colonies of mature megakaryocytes, and
        a further 3-4 days for these cells to exhibit proplatelets with the need of replating of a fresh serum free
        medium in between. The whole process took about 14 days which generated 40% ±16% megakaryocytes with protruding
        proplatelets. For every one of these megakaryocytes, scientists obtained about 240 platelets equating to a total
        of 9,600 ± 3,840 platelets produced (Choi et al., 1995). While this was not enough platelets and it was an
        expensive method, it became evident that it was possible to culture platelets in the laboratory.
    </p>

    <h2>Adipose tissue</h2>
    Bone marrow aspirates are difficult to obtain samples as well as painful. Umbilical cord it is not painful and
    relatively easy to obtain. However, only trained staff must be available on hand at the time of delivery to obtain
    blood. Recent studies have shown extraction of stem cells from adipose tissue which is much easier to obtain.
    Adipose tissue can be sourced from healthy subjects via liposuction. Cells are washed with various solutions under
    various temperatures to get rid of excess precipitates, this is done repeatedly over a few days resulting in a stem
    cell suspension ready for differentiating into MK cells. This method approximately results in 5000 fibroblast colony
    forming units (CFU-F) per gram of adipose tissue, compared with approximately 100–1000 CFU-F per ml of bone marrow,
    making it a much more favourable source of stem cells (Kolaparthy et al., 2015).

    <h2>Self-renewing MKs</h2>
    A study looking into self-renewing lineage progenitors found myeloid-restricted progenitors with long-term
    repopulating activity (MyRPs), which are specific to lineage specific megakaryocytes (MkRPs), megakaryocyte
    erythroid cells and common myeloid cells (CMRPs) in the haemopoietic stem cells. In the study, cells were combined
    with single transplantation with paired daughter cell assay which demonstrated copies of HSC and MkRPs. This was
    replicated in the daughter cells as HSC and CMRP’s. This showed the concept of replication without multipotent
    progenitors (Yamamoto et al., 2013).
    <p>A recent study carried out in the States found megakaryocyte progenitor cell lines (imMKCLs) obtained from either
        ESC clone KhES3 or iPSC clone 692D2 with c-MYC, BMI1 with the addition of BCL-XL protein at days 14-21 increased
        imMKCL’s over 5 months before showing any oncogenicity. These cells were viable even after cryopreservation,
        which suggests cells may be viable long enough for mass production.
    </p>

    <h2>Forward programming</h2>

    <p>Another approach to increasing MK cells were to forward programme megakaryocyte cells (fopMKs). MKs mixed with
        transcription factors GATA1, TAL1, and FLI1 to enhance MK lines. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 and Fibroblast
        growth factor 2 were initially added to induce mesoderm differentiation of iPSCs. This was followed up by stem
        cell factor and thrombopoietin to further derive MKs, and finally the addition of more thrombopoietin with
        interleukin-1β to allow production of platelets. Researchers were able to cryopreserve these cells and reuse
        when needed.
    </p>
    Using two different iPSC lines, they achieved MK lineage purity by day 15 post transduction with >50% CD42a+ mature
    MK cells by day 20. A cell expansion during the single cell culture step led to large quantities of MK cells with up
    to 28.4±7.8-fold increase at day 20 (see fig.4). As this process took ~20 days to initially induce
    mesoderm differentiation of iPSCs therefore may be difficult to rely on this method alone for platelet production.
    Another factor to take into account is the longer each step takes the more there could be a tendency to introduce
    oncogenicity in cells, however as this is a new concept, it would need to be further studied (Moreau et al., 2016).

    <p><img src="Images/FOPMks.JPG" alt="fopMKs" class="center"></p>


    <h2>Fibroblasts</h2>
    Human ﬁbroblasts HPS1 iPSC line (CHOPHPS1) have been shown to exhibit pluripotent stem cells. HPS1 iPSC line
    (CHOPHPS1) isolated from a patient carrying a duplicative mutation in the HPS1 gene, had OCT4, KLFF, SOX2 and C-MYC
    proteins reprogrammed into cell lines using a Cre-excisable polycistronic STEMCCA lentivirus (Maguire et al., 2016).
    <p>Another study found fibroblasts turning in MK cells eliminating the need for iPSCs. This study also highlighted
        that nuclear factor erythroid–derived 2 p45 unit (p45NF-E2), Maf G, and Maf K played a role in megakaryopoiesis
        and formation of platelets. This could be used to do further research on iPSC derived MK cells and observing
        yield platelet concentrations (Ono et al., 2012).
    </p>

    <h2>Large scale production</h2>
    As the method to create platelets ex vivo is perfected, the next stage would be to reproduce this method on a large
    scale. There have been two theories proposed including injecting MK cells directly into the patient or bioreactors
    which produce platelets commercially and transfuse platelets as units. To do this systems created must mimic the
    body’s niche complex from pH, temperature, chemical composition and constant energy to keep cells viable.
    <p>In order to create such a vessel, scientists have come up with the concept of a bioreactor. There have been
        various proposed platforms including 3D vascular microtubes by Di Buduo et al. their bioreactor’s key feature is
        the silk external layer which consists of protein biomaterial, it has properties that withstand the pressures of
        the bone marrow (see fig.5). They measured responses to stiffness, co culture with endothelial cells, shear
        stress, surface topography and changes in extracellular matrix composition. Through various adapting of each
        response, they updated their model which was able to produce a threefold increase yield of platelets from the
        initial design. They were able to generate 4x105 number of platelets.
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/silkspongelayer.JPG" alt="silkspongelayer" class="center"></p>

    <p>Another study carried out by Thon et al used factors which recapitulates the bone marrow to increase the output
        of proplatelets hence increase in platelet yield. They used hiPSC-MKs which began producing proplatelets within
        two hours of culture by manipulating the stress applied. They were able to view the microscopy live by forward
        and side scatter and measure production using flow cytometry. They were able to produce a total yield of ∼42
        PLTs per MK from 5.7×104 ± 3.4×104 MKs per ml (Thon et al., 2014).
    </p>
    <p>While this study produced results very quickly other studies such as that of Avanzi et al took much longer.
        Avanzi et al produced a step by step bioreactor which consisted of a membrane sandwiched between two flow
        chambers (see fig 6. It took 3 days to produce platelets which seems too long for large scale production unless
        it was a none stop flow coupled with donations from people. This would help with demand for platelets by
        decreasing the burden on blood banks but it could not rule out donations from people.
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/bioreacter.JPG" alt="bioreacter" class="center"></p>

    <h2>Using patients as bioreactors</h2>
    The majority of platelet production is completed in the bone marrow. However recent research has suggested
    megakaryocytes are also found in the lungs, which aid production of platelets. It is thought that megakaryocytes
    move from the bone marrow into the lungs thus producing up to 50% platelets per hour (see fig. 7) (Weyrich and
    Zimmerman, 2013).

    <p><img src="Images/megakaryocytes.JPG" alt="megakaryocytes" class="center"></p>


    Using the lungs as a reservoir for trapping intravenously infused live MK cells, the lungs are effectively turned in
    a live bioreactor with all the right conditions to synthesize MK cells to maturity, thus releasing the proplatelets
    into blood vessels and completing thrombopoiesis by releasing platelets. This method can effectively cut out many
    steps of mass producing platelets into a unit that can be safely transfused (Lefrançais et al., 2017).

    <h2>HLA and universal platelet generation</h2>
    Despite the promising results in producing platelets, there are factors to consider including platelet
    refractoriness and transfusion related reactions.
    The use of HLA typed platelets is common in platelet refractoriness. Platelet refractoriness occurs when patients
    are transfused multiple times, thus developing alloantibodies to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class epitopes,
    therefore the platelet count does not increment. A study by Gras et al injected NOD/SCID/IL-2Rγc(-/-) mice with
    specific silenced HLA antibodies were infused with 1 × 106 HLA-universal MKs. They found MK cells did not have
    antibody mediated complement activation or cell mediated cytotoxicity, thus proving that reprogramming iPSC cells
    are not only possible but it can be used to design an iPSC of a specific design (Gras et al, 2013).
    A study looking at HLA universally derived iPSCs developed megakaryocytes which were silenced for the HLA 1
    expression (see fig.8). They were able to successfully produce megakaryocytes which were silenced up to 82%, thus
    showing that universal HLA MK cells are viable and able to continue the silenced gene right through to fully fledged
    platelets (Borger and Eicke, 2016).

    <p><img src="Images/silencingHLA.JPG" alt="silencingHLA" class="center"></p>

    <h2>Transfusion related reactions </h2>
    Platelets are obtained from human donations. Obtaining donations is a challenge for blood banks because of the heavy
    reliance on information supplied by the donor. As people travel all over the world, they can carry a host of
    microorganisms which can get passed into the blood. Other factors such as exposure to chemicals, foods, illness,
    medication, and how the donation is obtained can affect the donation. In the UK, platelets are leukodepleted,
    bacterially screened and tested for specific pathogens such as HIV.
    <p>International haemovigilance schemes involve countries from Europe and rest of the world, who collect and publish
        data on transfusion transmitted infections (TTI’s) (SaBTO,2014). In the UK, platelet related transfusion
        reactions have been on the rise since 2014, until the introduction of platelets in additive solution along with
        educating clinicians to find alternatives to transfusion (see fig.9) (SHOT, 2016).
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/reactions.JPG" alt="reactions" class="center"></p>

    By introducing iPSCs to manufacture platelets, scientists can re-program cells to switch off signaling for HLA and
    HPA alloantigen’s, as well as other antigens such as Kell family. They can control the environment which cells are
    cultured effectively removing risks of contamination if microorganisms by keeping strict sterile conditions at all
    stages of manufacture. This will not only reduce the number of transfusion related reaction but as the platelets
    will be free from antigens, this means they would be universal and would be compatible with everyone.
    <p>Methods such as CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with CRISPR-associated
        protein 9) gene editing technology can be used to modify iPSC by editing the structure of the genome of
        interest. It is based on bacteria which capture selected areas of DNA from viruses. If a virus attacks again the
        bacteria uses protein CAS9 to splice a selected area of the virus and insert the RNA thus disabling the virus
        (Zhang et al., 2015).
    </p>

    <h2>Platelets in research</h2>
    Since to introduction of iPSC technology, it has opened up a whole new field of study to on ways to re-programme
    cells, thus creating personalised treatment regimens, if not potential cures to diseases (Singh et al., 2015). iPSCs
    overcame the ethical implications hanging over stem cell research as iPSCs are derived from somatic cells. The use
    of iPSCs has had huge advantages in research, as traditional methods of experimenting on animals and using knockout
    mice would no longer be needed. Problems such as the ‘flanking effect’ and masked genes of interest in adult mice
    would no longer be seen, as iPSCs concentrate on specific cells lines.
    <p>There have been various studies that have been successful in animals but failures in humans trials, but by using
        iPSCs, they closely mimic the cell line of interest in humans thus avoiding potential harm to human beings. It
        is also cheaper to grow cells under laboratory conditions that growing animals in the lab or the rendering the
        cost of clinical trials.
    </p>However, while there are many advantages to using iPSCs, it also has its disadvantages. In various studies
    carried out using iPSC, researchers have found a range of genetic abnormalities occurring when cells divide.
    Researchers found iPSC were more prone to oncogenicity. Ji et al performed exome sequencing (WES) of human
    fibroblasts & the derived iPSCs at two different passages. They found that in vitro passaging contributed 7% to the
    iPSC coding point mutation load, as well as 19% of the mutations pre-exist as rare mutations in the parental
    fibroblasts suggesting that the remaining 74% of the mutations were acquired during cellular reprogramming (Ji et
    al., 2012).

    <h2>Conclusion </h2>
    An ageing population lives longer, but can also develop diseases in later life and for longer durations. Patient
    illnesses may require management through multiple platelet transfusions. At present platelet donations are derived
    from human donations. These potentially have many risks including contamination from external sources such as
    microorganisms, storage, temperature and antibodies. Whilst transfusion committees educate health professionals on
    contamination risks and current data, invariably human errors are one of the factors shown to result in patients
    having a transfusion reaction to platelets. This is monitored through haemovigilance schemes such as Serious Hazards
    of Transfusion committee in the UK. To overcome this, scientists are developing ways to mass produce platelets
    derived from iPSC. This has created an exciting field of research combined with cutting edge research which brings
    man closer than ever to the idea of mass produced platelets. However it is increasingly difficult to obtain the
    correct balance of megakaryopoiesis which changes very quickly to produce platelets, all whilst trying to keep
    desirable conditions for maximum yield. It seems blood banks across the world will have to keep the excellent work
    they do in order to obtain platelets from the ever generous human donors for a few years if not decades to come.
