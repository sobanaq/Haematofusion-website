    <h1>Multiple Myeloma</h1>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a clonal B-cell disease. It is a result of slowly proliferating plasma cells in the bone
    marrow. It accounts for 2% of all cancer cases and ranks 17th most common cancer in the UK (2015) (Cancer Research
    UK, 2016; ONS, 2017). The UK has seen a 29% increase in the incidence of MM since the early 1990s (see fig 1). In
    2014, mortality showed 5 in every 100,000 males and 4 in every 100,000 deaths in the UK. The mean age of diagnosis
    is 85-87 at its peak (Cancer Research UK, 2016).
    It is suggested that reduced immunity, family history of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), or
    radiation can increase the risk of MM. MM is more common in Afro- Caribbean people than Caucasian and Asian
    populations worldwide.

    <h2>Pathogenesis</h2>

    <p>Cytogenetic changes in plasma cells lead to the abnormal production of plasma cells. Due to low proliferation
        over a period of time, these only counts for 30-50% of cases detected to have this abnormal karyotype. The
        normal function of plasma cells is to produce antibodies against foreign microorganisms. In MM, immature B cells
        encounter foreign substance which damaging the structure of the DNA in some form (Kuehl & Bergsagel, 2012). This
        damage can be in the form of a deletion, addition, or translocation of a chromosome as well as hyperdipoloidy.
        In other instances point mutations can occur whereby the DNA structure is changed.
    </p>
    <p>MM cells proliferate in the bone marrow niche and stimulation via cytokines, adhesion molecules and angiogenesis.
    </p>

    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Diagnosis of MM involves a range of tests. The International Myeloma Working Group updated the criteria for
        diagnosing MM in 2014, to look for seven factors as opposed to the four that made up the acronym C.R.A.B; simply
        put this was raised calcium, renal problems, anaemia, and bone problems. Now it includes C.R.A.B as well as
        spotting biomarkers of malignancy.
    </p>
    <p>Routine blood tests are usually the first step in diagnosis. A full blood count, morphology screen, chemistry
        profile including serum creatinine, uric acid, LDH, urinalysis and liver function tests are amongst the initial
        tests performed. While these tests are not specific in establishing the diagnosis of MM, they are useful when
        putting together with symptoms in aiding a clinical interpretation and thus forming the basis for a prognosis.
    </p>

    <h2>Bone destruction </h2>
    Patients usually present with bone pain due to the destruction of bone by osteoclasts at a quicker rate than bone
    replacement by osteoblasts. It can lead to osteopenia, bone lesions and fractures thus leading to severe pain. This
    is further instigated by the release of calcium from bone destruction thus leading to hypercalcemia. As bone
    continues to weaken, it can also lead to the collapse of the spine as it buckles under weakness and stress on the
    bones (Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, 2018). It is therefore important for the clinician to check the bones.
    X- Rays confirm damage to bone as lesions show up in lateral scans. CAT and MRI scans are performed to identify the
    extent of damage as they are more sensitive. Bone damage is further supported with a bone profile including ALP,
    albumin, phosphate and calcium.

    <h2>Renal complications</h2>
    Renal impairment occurs in one fifth of patients with MM. The most common causes of renal failure is due to
    hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, toxic agents, and dehydration. If left untreated, this can cause irreversible damage
    to the kidneys. A major component of kidney damage is excess monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC’s)
    produced during plasma cell dyscrasia. As the kidney tries to breakdown FLC, it cannot keep up with the circulating
    levels of FLC and proximal tubule sites are quickly taken up. This causes a considerable accumulation of FLC in the
    tubule leading to blockage and reduced capacity of the kidney. This in turn leads to the kidney unable to retain
    water thus patients present with a constant feeling of being thirsty. As the blockage increases, this releases
    various cytokine responses and activates redox pathways leading to inflammation (see fig 3) (Hutchison et al, 2012).

    <p><img src="Images/endocytosis.JPG" alt="endocytosis" class="center"></p>

    <h2>Anaemia</h2>
    60% of patients affected by anaemia. Anaemia is caused by loss of red blood cells either by bleeding or lack of
    production of more red blood cells by the bone marrow. Most patients remain remix course of their disease lifetime.
    This can be alleviated through red cell transfusions, which raises the red cell count as well as haemoglobin
    (Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, 2018) . A study looking at anaemia in multiple myeloma showed patients had
    increased serum hepcidin levels. Hepcidin is it protein which who regulates the entry of iron. It is also
    responsible for inflammation. They suggested that hepcidin contributes to MM related anaemia (Maes et al, 2010).

    <h2>Infections</h2>
    Recurrent infections are a major cause of illness in patients with MM. This is due to opportunistic pathogens
    manifesting as well as dampening of the immune system via treatments such as chemotherapy and immunosuppressant
    drugs (Blimark et al, 2014). Has cancer cells destroy normal antibodies and produce faulty white blood cells, this
    leads to complications in fighting disease as well as raising the risk of repeated infections. A study looking at
    infection rates in myeloma patients found they were 7.1 times more likely to get a bacterial or viral infection;
    this was even higher during the first year after diagnosis as patients were 10 times more likely to develop an
    infection during this time (The Myeloma Beacon, 2013; Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, 2018).

    <h2>Others</h2>
    <p>As plasma cells turn malignant, this causes an overproduction of paraproteins by the malignant plasma cells.
        These paraproteins are detectable in serum and urine. These are also known as Bence Jones proteins. These
        proteins are either kappa or Lambda type. It is only IgG which is overproduced in MM. They are found in the
        urine and serum due to decreased kidney filtration renal failure as discussed previously. They are detected by
        electrophoresis or serum free light chain assays (Cancer Research UK, 2015; Luckerath et al.,2013).
    </p>
    <p>Bone marrow aspirate, biopsies and plasma cell morphology are crucial for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
        Biopsies allow sampling of several different depths of bone marrow enhancing the prognosis of MM. A peripheral
        blood film can you show over 10% abnormal plasma cells which are indicative of MM. Auer rods, round inclusions
        such as a Russell bodies can also occur (Ribourtout and Zandecki, 2015.)
    </p>

    <h2>The British Society of Haematology (BCSH)</h2>
    <p>BCSH has published guidelines for diagnosing MM taken from health experts data from around the world.
    </p>
    <p>The major guideline for diagnosis and management of MM, were published in 2006, but were recently revised in 2014
        with the GRADE system (see Fig.4).
    </p>

    <h2>Disease Staging</h2>
    <p>Clinicians use diagnostic testing to determine the stage of MM. With the outcome of the disease survival rates
        and determine the prognosis. There are two staging systems. The Durie-Salmon staging system is the older,
        outdated system but is still sometimes used. It has three stages, low cell mass (stage I), neither stage I or
        III (stage II), and high cell mass (stage III) (All about Blood, 2015).
    </p>
    <p>International staging system (ISS) is the preferred new style of staging. It is based on the assessment of best
        results of beta 2 microglobulin and albumin. It has three stages (see Fig.5) (Cancer Research UK, 2015).
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/ISSstagingsystem.JPG" alt="ISSstagingsystem" class="center"></p>

    <p>Myeloma can also occur without symptoms which is known as smouldering or asymptomatic myeloma. Patients with
        smouldering myeloma present with a level paraprotein of more than 30g/L, 10% to 60% abnormal plasma cells in the
        bone marrow, and no related organ or tissue damage. As these patients do not clinically have malignant myeloma
        they are monitored every 3 months for any symptoms and worsening of the condition (Cancer Research UK, 2015).
    </p>

    <h2>Current Treatment</h2>
    <p>Until cure becomes possible there are two aims that are taken into account when deciding treatment regimen for
        patients with multiple myeloma. These include bringing the myeloma under control and preventing aggressive
        relapse, and treating secondary symptoms such as bone pain, anaemia and infections (NHS, 2018). During the
        mid-1900s, treatment for multiple myeloma relied on patients getting ill first, as the clinician had very little
        treatment options available. Treatment consisted of chemotherapy and steroids. As research continued and more
        drugs were invented this not only expanded treatment options but improved life expectancy for patients as well
        (Vargesson, 2015).
    </p>
    <p>Today the decision for treatment regimens for multiple myeloma can be grouped into non-intensive and intensive
        treatment. Non-intensive treatment is aimed at older, less fit patients which are more common as it is found in
        older people. Intensive treatments are usually aimed at younger, fitter patients as it is more toxic (NHS,
        2018).
    </p>
    <p>Treatment options range from chemotherapy, steroids, stem cell transplant and drugs such as Thalidomide and
        Bortezomide (see fig.6). Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug which was first marketed in 1950s for sickness
        in pregnant women. Unfortunately this had negative consequences as it causes birth defects. The mechanism of
        action of thalidomide has only recently become in the last 5 years. A study carried out by Zhu et al in 2011
        found that thalidomide's primary targets is cereblon (CRBN). Cereblon is a protein encoded by the CRBN gene. It
        is found on human chromosome 3. Thalidomide inhibits Tumour Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), suppresses angiogenesis,
        increases cell mediated cytotoxic effects and modulates adhesion molecule expression. TNF-α is inhibited
        degradation of TNF-α mRNA increasing the activity of alpha 1 acid glycoprotein. Apoptosis is triggered
        activation of caspase-8 pathway to release apoptotic proteins (Latif et al, 2012).
    </p>

    <p><img src="Images/CRABcriteria.JPG" alt="CRABcriteria" class="center"></p>

    <p>Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor, the main mechanism of action is to induce apoptosis by inhibiting the NF-kB
        pathway. In multiple myeloma the NF-kB pathway is out of sync. It keeps the expression of genes permanently
        'on', which allows the continual proliferation of the cancer cells, and provides cell protection from apoptosis.
        Hideshima et al showed Bortezomib increased expression of phosphorylation of IkBα and down regulated IkBα. They
        also suggested Bortezomib blocking non-canonical NF-kB pathway by inhibiting proteasome dependent conversion of
        p100 to p53.
    </p>

    <p>Other mechanisms of Bortezomib include the accumulation proteins, which cause stress in the endoplasmic reticulum
        and lead to the inhibition of angiogenesis, down regulation of growth factor receptors, and adhesion molecule
        expression suppression. However Bortezomib can lead to resistance due to inhibition of cellular responses
        mediating these downstream effects (Gandolfi et al, 2017).
    </p>

    <p>Researchers continue to look for novel treatment in different combinations, whether its old drugs mixed with
        different therapies such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy; or transplants used in conjunction with biological
        therapies. The NHS in conjunction with MHRA and other research authorities offer patients to join clinical
        trials for new treatments which may then come into practice. Monoclonal antibodies which target CD38, is a new
        therapeutic agent for MM. CD38 is a multifunctional glycoprotein which is expressed on the tumour cells. The
        main function of CD38 on tumour cells is to protect them from natural killer cytotoxicity. However various
        studies have targeted this glycoprotein, and have noted positive effects in disrupting this mechanism therefore
        rendering cell lysis of tumour cell (Van de Donk et al., 2016). Daratumumab a monoclonal antibody is the first
        drug of its kind, which has recently been approved for use in the NHS (Myeloma UK, 2017). It is indicated for
        the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior types of treatment.
        Daratumumab works by attaching to the CD38 protein on the tumor cell and initiates immune-mediated responses,
        direct action on the tumor cell and immunoregulatory actions to initiate cell death. Immune mediated responses
        include complement dependent cytotoxicity which lyses myeloma cells; antibody-dependent cell-mediated
        cytotoxicity which activates natural killer cells, t cells, neutrophils and macrophages. Macrophages are induced
        which initiate phagocytosis (Darzalex HCP, 2017). Direct action of Daratumumab induces programmed cell death of
        tumor cell lines when cross-linked with FC receptors, which are present on the surface of the tumour cell
        (Overdijk et al., 2016). However Daratumumab interferes with serological testing as it binds to CD38 on red
        blood cells. This causes positive results in Indirect Antiglobulin test (IAT), therefore masking detection of
        antibodies to antigens in the patient serum. Standard blood bank techniques show pan-reactivity in antibody
        identification panels, and red blood cell cross matches, therefore all requests for blood products are sent to
        NHS reference laboratories for extensive testing. All patients taking Daratumumab must be monitored carefully
        and blood products must be ordered in advance in case of emergencies (Chari et al., 2015; Chapuy et al., 2015).
    </p>

    <h2>Research and Clinical Trials</h2>
    <p>There are various clinical trials on-going which look at different stages of myeloma. These include relapsed,
        refractory, high risk myeloma and newly diagnosed. This trial looks to alleviate secondary symptoms caused by MM
        or looking at various therapies for treatment.
    </p>
    <p>Currently there is a single arm, open label, multicentre phase I/II trial looking at CAR T cell therapy. It is
        investigating whether AUTO2, a type of treatment known as chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy is effective
        in myeloma patients. This is a new type of immunotherapy in which patients T cells are harvested and genetically
        modified in the laboratory (Ali et al., 2015; Kochenderfer and Rosenberg, 2013). Phase one of the trial is
        looking at the safety and dose-response of AUTO2. Patients undergo T cell harvest a minimum of 35 days before
        treatment. During this time they are given immunosuppressive drugs called Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide,
        which dampen immune system and almost strip it bare. This is a particularly sensitive time for the patient
        because they are more prone to infections, which could be lethal due to effectively very few or no white cells
        in the body. Patient T cells that were harvested, are modified to recognise two molecules, BCMA and TACI, which
        are present on the surface of myeloma cells. These are then transfused back into the patient, where they home to
        the bone marrow niche. Phase 2 of the trial is going to evaluate the activity of AUTO2 (Cancer Research UK,
        2017).
    </p>
    <p>There are many other trials some of which include but not limited to:</p>

    <p><img src="Images/trialtable.JPG" alt="trialtable" class="center"></p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To conclude, multiple myeloma is a disease that manifests in plasma cells, which is incurable. It accounts for 2%
        of all cancer cases in the UK. Multiple myeloma is more common in Afro-Caribbean population than any other
        ethnicity.
    </p>
    <p>The DNA of plasma cells causes the cells to turn into tumour cells. T cells have a slow turnover and very generic
        symptoms which makes diagnosis more difficult. Peak age for diagnosis is usually around 85 to 87 years old.
        Diagnosis of MM relies on BCSH guidelines which state seven key factors for diagnosing MM, including C.R.A.B and
        biomarkers.
    </p>
    <p>At present NHS hospitals treat patients with a combination of treatments including drugs such as immunomodulatory
        drugs, steroids, chemotherapy, radiation and stem cell transplants. There is on-going research into new
        treatment regimens which target different areas of the tumour cells. One such drug is Daratumumab, which is the
        CD38 monoclonal antibody. It targets the antigens on the surface of the tumour cells, thus initiating the
        immunological pathways to kill the tumour cells. During trials this has proven successful thus becoming licensed
        for use in England and Wales.
    </p>
    <p>There are lots of other trails which focus on treating the symptoms of MM as well as targeting the myeloma cells.
        Therefore researchers must be careful when tagging these cells, as to not switch off any other pathways in the
        body. While the search continues to find a suitable cocktail of therapies, it seems in an ageing population this
        may be difficult as the body can only tolerate so much.
