   <h2 class="title">Haemolytic Disease of the Feotus and Newborn (HDFN)</h2>


   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   Haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDFN) is a potentially fatal alloimmune disorder which affects newborn babies and
   the foetus. Maternal IgG antibodies are produced in response to foreign antigen exposure on foetal erythrocytes.
   These antibodies cross the placenta barrier thus attacking the foetal erythrocytes and causing red cell destruction
   (Dean, 2005; Kurosaki et al., 2015). This results in foetal anaemia, hydrops fetalis and other clinical features.
   In 1939, Levine and Stetson first reported a severe transfusion reaction in a woman who had an ABO-compatible blood
   transfusion from her husband, but then later suffered a postpartum haemorrhage following macerated delivery. It was
   thought the infant inherited something from the father, which was foreign to the mother. This is what we know today
   as Anti-D (Latendre, 2017).

   <h2>Aetiology</h2>
   <p>In order to understand the aetiology of HDFN, the role of pregnancy needs to be understood in context to the
      placenta. During fertilisation, mitosis occurs forming blastocysts, which forms the embryo. As rapid division
      occurs the cells form a layer of specialised cells called Trophoblasts. Trophoblasts eventually form the outer
      layer of the placenta where they act as the main placental barrier in exchanging nutrients, waste and other cells
      from the mother to the foetus, and vice versa.(Zhang et al., 2013)(Mor and Kwon, 2015). During pregnancy, the
      placenta is the main connection between the mother and foetus.
      It consists of the Chorion; the outer layer, which protects and nurtures the embryo, and the Decidua, which forms
      the maternal portion of the uterus lining. (Duttaroy and Basak, 2016)
      This trophoblastic barrier acts as a defence to the mother’s immune response. It does this by expressing ‘false’
      antigens in Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I proteins. These antigens cleave to the antigen sites on
      the uterine Natural Killer cells thus evading detection by the mother’s white cells. Human leukocyte Antigens
      (HLA) are specific proteins, which play this role by binding to the ‘false’ antigens therefore promoting
      pregnancy. (Bainbridge, 2000); (Dąbrowska et al., 2014) (See figure 1.)
   </p>

   <p><img src="Images/HDFNHLAexpressions.jpg" alt="HDFNHLAexpressions" class="center"></p>

   <p>If this barrier breaks for any reason, it causes Fetomaternal Haemorrhage (FMH). FMH is the loss of foetal blood
      into the mother’s circulation during pregnancy or labour; when trauma occurs.
      It is unlikely for a bleed of >1ml to occur during pregnancy. However during labour this can reach ≥30ml in about
      0.3% pregnancies, particularly when there is a trauma. (Kim and Makar, 2012). Exposure to foetal red cells with
      antigens foreign to the mother, initiates an IgM response.
      IgM response involves macrophages in the mother’s circulation identifying the antigen on foetal cell as foreign,
      such as RhD positive foetal cells in an RhD negative mother. (Figure 2) This breaks down the cell into an RhD
      peptide and MCH class II complex. This complex produces cytokines, which attract B and T cells to the area, which
      produces a cocktail of immunological cells, which in turn causes B cells to differentiate into plasma cells and
      initiating a large amount of RhD antibodies production and replicating the whole mechanism on a larger scale.
      Antibodies of IgM type are too large to pass the placenta barrier therefore do not cause harm in the first
      pregnancy. Naïve B cells circulate for a number of years in the
      mother’s circulatory system, if the body was exposed to the same antigen again, the body would recognise the
      antigen as foreign much quicker and initiate a response. It does not require T cell stimulation (Dean, 2005;
      Blaney and Howard, 2009; Kurosaki et al., 2015.). This is known as sensitisation.
   </p>

   <p>There are three main causes of maternal sensitisation leading to foetal red cell destruction. These are ABO
      incompatibility, Rh incompatibility and other antibody incompatibility.
   </p>

   <h2>ABO incompatibility</h2>

   <p>The ABO blood group system is the most clinically significant because it can have the most profound effect on the
      transfusion recipient if ABO-incompatible blood is given. In HDFN, 15% of all pregnancies are caused by mother who
      is group O and the foetus that is group A, B or AB; giving rise to the complement cascade. As Anti A and Anti B of
      the IgM type is present in the group O mother, they are too large to pass the placenta barrier. If FMH occurs at
      any stage in pregnancy, this elicits an IgG type response which are much smaller isohemagglutinins; allowing
      maternal Anti A and B to cross into the placental barrier and causing foetal red cell destruction (see Figure 3).
      (Boes, 2000; Qureshi et al., 2014).
   </p>

   <h2>Rh incompatibility</h2>
   <p>RhD incompatibility occurs when the mother is RhD negative and the baby is RhD positive. The level of damage is
      dependent on the volume of bleed, so a few millilitres may not harbour a response at all but a trauma causing a
      large bleed of over 5ml may illicit a larger immune response. In a mother’s first pregnancy, FMH during pregnancy
      or labour cause memory B cells to sensitise, which remain in the mother’s circulation for a number of years. In
      subsequent pregnancies, the B cells activate in the presence of the RhD positive foetal antigens thus causing
      haemolysis of the foetal red cells (figure 3). (de Haas et al., 2015). Worldwide HDFN due to RhD incompatability
      remains to be the leading cause particularly where screening programmes are poor or do not exist at all.
      (Hendrickson and Delaney, 2016)
   </p>

   <h2>Other blood group incompatibility</h2>
   <p>HDFN can occur due to other antibodies such as Anti-E, Anti-c, Anti-C, Anti-Kell, and antibodies from the Duffy,
      MNS and Kidd blood group systems, recognising foetal antigens. There can also be a combination such as Anti-c and
      Anti-E, which can be severe. This type of HDFN occurs due to previous incompatible transfusions for the mother or
      previous pregnancy in which these antigens were incompatible between mother and child. (Klein and Anstee, 2013).
      In the western part of the world Kell group of antibodies is the developing cause of HDFN. (Hendrickson and
      Delaney, 2016)
   </p>

   <h2>Epidemiology</h2>
   <p>HDFN affected 1% of all neonates. This was equivalent to 1 in every 2200 births. Antiprophlaxis treatment
      (discussed
      later) was introduced in the 1970s, which dropped this figure dramatically and is considered one of the major
      breakthroughs in medical history. In the UK this is about 500 foetus affected by HDFN or about 16% of pregnancies
      in
      Caucasians females. (Qureshi et al., 2014). All RhD negative mothers now receive routine Anti –D prophylaxis
      treatment as part of their antenatal programme in the NHS. It was estimated that in 2005, without antiprophylactic
      treatment, 1% of all RhD negative mothers giving birth to RhD positive babies would have been sensitised thus
      affecting subsequent pregnancies (NICE, 2008).</p>

   <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
   <p>Severity of HDFN can be measured is dependent on the type of HDFN. The symptoms range from mild to severe and even
      fatal in some instances. The type of HDFN is diagnosed using a variety of haematology, biochemistry and serology
      tests.</p>

   <p><img src="Images/HDFNRhD.JPG" alt="HDFNsensitisation" class="center"></p>

   RhD incompatibility symptoms can be mild to severe. These range from jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and oedema.
   Severely affected babies develop anaemia in utero and jaundice within hours of being born.

   <p><img src="Images/HDFNRhD2.JPG" alt="HDFNsensitisation2" class="center"></p>

   <h2>Hydrops Fetalis</h2>
   <p>Hydrops Fetalis is a collection of symptoms, which can occur pre-birth. This can cause severe physical changes in
      the baby, which can be fatal. While it is a condition in its own right with symptoms ranging from anaemia, oedema
      and eventually kernicterus, it is quite rare since the introduction of screening methods during pregnancy.
   </p>

   <h2>Anaemia</h2>
   <p>Foetal red cells are removed from circulation due to maternal antibodies breaking down the cells, This limits the
      level of oxygen available to pump round the foetus’ organs, causing anaemia and pale skin when born. As there is
      lack of oxygen, this can also cause breathing problems as the kidneys do not have enough oxygen to pump around the
      body, and are further restricted due to oedema squeezing the organs. Lack of early intervention may develop into
      lethargy and Opsithotonus, which is due to spasms of the spine and muscles in the back causing backward arching of
      the head, neck and spine in the neonate.
      Anaemia can also lead to portal hypertension causing the liver to reduce albumin production. This causes abnormal
      fluid leakage just beneath the skin known as oedema. (de Haas et al., 2015)
   </p>

   <h2>Hepatosplenomegaly</h2>
   <p>As erythrocytes have a shortened life, the spleen and liver try to compensate for this loss by increasing the
      productions of red cells, this causes both organs to enlarge as they try to meet demand.
   </p>

   <h2>Jaundice</h2>
   <p>The foetus’ immature liver is unable to breakdown unconjugated bilirubin thus resulting in an accumulation of
      bilirubin levels in the body, which is visible in the skin and eyes and amniotic fluid. Unconjugated bilirubin can
      also result in Kernicterus.(Vilambil et al., 2017)
   </p>

   <h2>Kernicterus</h2>
   <p>When the kidneys cannot eliminate bilirubin, it is transported to the liver where it binds with albumin giving
      rise to unconjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin is a lipid soluble molecule which can cross the blood brain
      barrier, this leads to damage to the brain particularly the cerebellum, basal gangilia and neuronal
      membranes.(Bhutani and Johnson-Hamerman, 2015; Ree et al., 2017).
      This is usually the last stage of HDFN because the body cannot handle the levels of unconjugated bilirubin
      therefore it starts to store it instead, if left this can be fatal.
   </p>

   <h3 class="title">Diagnosis</h3>

   <h2>Pre birth</h2>

   <h2>Amniocentesis</h2>
   Amniocentesis is offered during the fifteenth week of pregnancy and beyond. This is when bilirubin levels peak.
   Nevertheless, it is considered an uncomfortable procedure as well as carrying its own fetomaternal haemorrhage risks.

   <h1>Method</h1>
   Using the Ultrasound as a guide, a 22mm gauge needle is inserted through the mothers abdominal wall to the amniotic
   fluid. A sample of between 20-30ml is then drawn. The sample is then sent to the laboratory where red cell
   destruction and bilirubin can be assessed. (NHS, 2016)
   The fluid is passed through a spectrophotometer, which records the absorbance at a specified wavelength. This
   absorbance is then plotted against the gestational age of the foetus on a Liley graph.

   <p><img src="Images/HDFNlileygraph.jpg" alt="HDFNlileygraph" class="center"></p>


   <h2>Antibody test</h2>
   A Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) also known as Direct Coombs Test (DCT) can be carried out which is a qualitative
   test. The DAT looks at red cell agglutination in the presence of antibody or complement activation. The stronger the
   agglutination, the more maternal antibody is coating the foetal red cells, hence greater levels of haemolysis
   .(Labtests, 2014); (Parker and Tormey, 2017)
   There are various commercial platforms available to do the DAT such as test tube method, micro-titre plates and gel
   system.

   <h2>Gel card method</h2>

   The test involves adding 25-50µl patients red cells to a test card containing columns of gel coated with polyspecific
   antihuman globulin with beads in each; The card is then centrifuged which pulls the red cells through the column with
   beads. If cells agglutinate, they are trapped within the beads depending on the affinity of agglutination between red
   cells. Red cells usually agglutinate at the top of the gel and red cells that have not reacted fall to the bottom of
   the well. In order to differentiate the reaction, a monospecific card is used. The columns on the monospecific are
   coated with Anti-IgG, IgA,IgM, C3c and C3d. Again, patient red cells are added to each well and centrifuged. The
   result is then graded from 0 being no reaction to 4 where strong agglutination has occurred (figure 5).(Direct
   Antiglobulin Test and Elution Study, 2016)


   <p><img src="Images/HDFNDATcard.jpg" alt="HDFNDATcard" class="center"></p>

   <p>The DAT is a crude test because it dependent on the user to grade the level of reaction from 0 being the weakest
      to 4 being the strongest; this may vary user to user.
   </p>

   <h2>Antibody titres</h2>
   Antibody titres can be determined once a positive DAT is found. This is measured by diluting the plasma until on
   agglutination is found and performing IAT test on the sample. This can pick up which antibody is present and at what
   titre level. This can be done on titres <1:32 every 4 weeks til 24 weeks and every 2 weeks after til birth. Titres>
      1:32 dilution Dopplers every 1 to 2 weeks to assess severity of antibody and decide if early birth is
      required.(Direct Antiglobulin Test and Elution Study, 2016)


      <h2>Elution studies</h2>

      Elution studies are a good indication of identifying an antibody if DAT test is positive. It can only be done on
      IgG bound red cells however. Elution is performed by removing the antibody from the coated red cells and then
      identifying the antibody via a 10 cell IAT panel using known reagents.

      <h1>Method</h1>
      There are various ways to unbind antibody from cells such as heat, pH, temperature, freeze thaw, and acid elution
      to name a few.
      An example of elution study which is used by the NHS Blood and Transfusion Reference laboratories, is elution
      combined with absorption. Patient plasma is treated with known reagent, to free the antibody from the foetal cell.
      The absorbed plasma is then be used to identify the antibody using a panel by IAT and enzyme (McManus,A. 2017).

      <p><img src="Images/HDFNelusion.JPG" alt="HDFNelusionstudies" class="center"></p>

      If an in house test is not available in a hospital, testing for elution studies is sent to RCI laboratories set up
      by NHS Blood Transfusion Service to test instead. (Direct Antiglobulin Test and Elution Study, 2016); (BTS
      Transport, 2017)

      <h2>Ultrasound</h2>
      Ultrasonography testing is a relatively cheap and easy method which is used to diagnose pleural effusions,
      pericardial effusions, skin oedema, ascites and view dilations in in the heart.
      <h1>Method</h1>
      Gel is applied to the mothers stomach; on which a wand is applied and moved around the stomach. The resulting
      projections are viewed on a monitor usually in 2D/3D. The images directly show the internal organs of the
      foetus.(Aagaard-Tillery et al., 2016)

      <h2>Foetal Doppler test</h2>
      A Doppler is a specific type of Ultrasound whereby the speed of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery is
      measured. Anaemia can be assessed because the blood is thinner thus increased velocity in blood flow. This is
      usually the first test requested by clinicians for anaemia because it has high specificity and is very sensitive.
      It is also none invasive (Moise, 2008).

      <p><img src="Images/Dopplerscan.JPG" alt="Dopplerscan" class="center"></p>

      <h2>Percutaneous cord blood test</h2>
      Percutaneous cord blood test also known as Cordocentisis, is a procedure, which collects foetal blood. It is
      similar to amniocentesis in that an ultrasound machine is used to guide a blood collection needle into the hepatic
      vein or umbilical cord. However, this method does carry a further risk of fetomaternal haemorrhage and
      miscarriage. (Knipe, 2017)

      <h2>Kleihauer-Betke test</h2>
      The Kleihauer-Betke is a smear test, which determines foetal maternal haemorrhage (FMH). It is based on elution
      studies as it relies on ‘masking’ maternal haemoglobin (HbA) by using an acid to elute the cells out. The
      haemoglobin in foetal cells (HbF) is more acid resistant thus remaining intact when washed with acid. The smear is
      then stained in haematoxylin and eosin. The HbF cells appear bright pink, which are counted and put into a
      formula, taking into account maternal cells and volume. (Austin et al., 2009; Kumpel et al., 2013; Gielezynska et
      al., 2014).


      <h2>Mollison’s formula</h2>
      Mollison’s formula makes various assumptions including:

      <li>maternal red cell volume is 1800ml</li>
      <li>foetal cells are 22% larger than maternal cells</li>
      <li>only 92% of cells stain darkly</li>

      Therefore, FMH is calculated as:

      <p><img src="Images/Mollinsons.JPG" alt="Mollinsonsformula" class="center"></p>

      Although it is a cheap method, it is open to many flaws such as:
      <li>Staining technique is different user to user.</li>
      <li>Strength of the stain to bind to HbF cells.</li>
      <li>Strength of acid to elute HbA cells.</li>
      <li>Reticulocytes resist elusion and would therefore appear as HbF cells.</li>
      <li>The degree of elusion and stain will vary from patient to patient (anaemic patients).
      </li>
      <li>Conditions such as sickle anaemia, β thalassaemia, hereditary foetal haemoglobin (HPFH) have HbF present
         therefore will give a false positive result.
      </li>
      <li>Open to interpreter error</li>

      <h2>Flow Cytometry</h2>
      Another method for calculating foetal cells is flow cytometry. The technique involves treating maternal blood with
      florescent markers, which detect the required antibody on the HbF cells. The most common being RhD positive cells
      in a RhD negative mother.
      Mollison’s formula is applied again to calculate FMH assuming maternal red cell volume is 1800ml and foetal cells
      are 22% larger than maternal cells:

      <p><img src="Images/Mollinsons2.JPG" alt="Mollinsonsformula2" class="center"></p>

      <p>This method is much more accurate but also expensive. It also requires a specialist user to interpret the
         results, which may not be feasible for regular hospitals. Although there is no standardisation of flow
         cytometry method, guidelines from British Society for Haematology were issued in 1999, and updated in 2009 on
         methods of estimation of FMH.(Austin et al., 2009)
      </p>


      <h3 class="title">After birth</h3>
      <h2> Cord blood testing</h2>
      Babies with suspected HDFN can be diagnosed by collecting a blood cord sample straight after birth. This is stored
      for up to 7 days and can have a variety tests performed such as:
      <li>ABO blood group</li>
      <li>RhD testing</li>
      <li>DAT</li>
      <li>Elution testing against A, B and O cells</li>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <h2>Anti-D prophylaxis</h2>
      <p>RhD negative mothers suspected of carrying RhD foetus’ are given prophylaxis treatment throughout their
         pregnancy to neutralise the fetal cells before mother’s immune system has chance to become sensitized. Anti-D
         prophylaxis treatment remains one the success stories in the medical world. Since its introduction in the 1970s
         mortality rates fell considerably. In so much that the National Health Service in the UK have introduced
         routine anti-natal anti-D prophylaxis (RAADP) which aims to treat all non-sensitised RhD pregnant women. There
         is 16% chance of the mother making Anti D, if not treated by antiprophylaxis treatment (Qureshi et al., 2014).
      </p>
      Recommended doses :
      <li>2 dose regimen of 500IU at 28 weeks and then 500IU at 34 weeks</li>
      <li>1 dose regiment of 1500IU at 28-34 weeks</li>

      <h2>Phototherapy</h2>
      Phototherapy is a treatment used to treat excess levels of bilirubin in a baby after birth. This takes place soon
      after birth, whereby the baby is kept in an incubator with a lamp, which transmits light at 420-480nm wavelength
      (blue spectrum). This coverts bilirubin to biliverdin, which is then, be broken down by the liver (Murray and
      Roberts, 2007).

      <h2>Immunoglobulin therapy</h2>
      Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is given to stop a baby from destroying its red blood cells. IgG
      immunoglobulins occupies Fc receptor sites on the macrophages in the foetal cells. As these sites are occupied,
      maternal IgG antibodies fail to attach and lyse the cells thus rendering them useless.
      <p>It is usually given in conjunction with phototherapy so bilirubin levels also return to normal. (NHS, 2015b);
         (NICE, 2015)
      </p>

      <h2> Intrauterine transfusion</h2>
      <p>If phototherapy fails or bilirubin is ≥20mg/dL, the baby must undergo an exchange transfusion. This involves
         removing the baby’s blood through a tube and replacing with donor red cells. This removes bilirubin present in
         the circulation as well as replacing antibody-coated red cells with antigen negative donor cells(NHS, 2015a). A
         successful exchange transfusion can treat anaemia, reduce maternal antibody, reduce bilirubin levels and reduce
         level of sensitised red cells.(Blaney and Howard, 2009)
      </p>
      <p>Rh HDFN effected babies usually require exchange transfusion to reduce bilirubin levels and prevent
         Kernicterus. In severe cases of jaundice, babies undergo combined therapy such as exchange transfusion and
         phototherapy.
      </p>

      <h2>Monitoring</h2>
      HDFN is monitored throughout a RhD negative mother or suspected HDFN mother at various stages throughout the
      pregnancy through the NHS antenatal screening programme. Blood testing is done early in the pregnancy to rule out
      disease including Rh disease. As well as antiprophylaxis treatment given, if the disease is present; further
      testing is offered throughout the pregnancy to observe titre levels and treatment is given where necessary. (NHS,
      2015b)

      <h2>Future</h2>
      <p>As discussed earlier the introduction of antiprophylaxis treatment given to RhD negative mothers has had a
         marked dropped in the number of RhD effected babies. This has led to a further decrease because of the
         introduction of all RhD negative mothers receiving antiprophylaxis under the NHS. While this has had a positive
         impact of HDFN affected babies, recent advances in prevention continue to be the main area of research.
      </p>
      <p>One such method is obtaining free foetal cells and extracting the genetic makeup of the foetus readily
         available to look for abnormalities that may cause problems in the pregnancy.
      </p>
      <p>Cell free foetal DNA(cffDNA) testing is a new test observing DNA obtained from foetal trophoblasts. Foetal
         trophoblasts are readily available in maternal blood, but can only be detected at around ≥4 weeks of gestation.
         It is easy to obtain and non-invasive procedure because a routine blood sample can be obtained where DNA is
         extracted by methods such as PCR.
      </p>
      <p> cFFDNA has been used to obtain information on RhD status of baby; which is useful in an RhD negative woman. It
         has also been used to identify blood antibody status particularly Kell and human platelet antigen.
      </p>
      <p>At present cFFDNA is not offered as part of routine screening because accuracy of results can very. It is only
         offered under the advice of consultant haematologist. Testing takes place at International Blood Group
         Reference Laboratories (IBGRL) in Bristol, England, which is a specialist diagnostic centre for NHS Blood
         Transfusion Service. (NHS Trust, 2014; (BITS), 2017).
      </p>
      <p>Another reason cFFDNA is not offered in routine laboratories is due to the changing dynamics of the National
         Health Service. It is increasingly difficult to bring new technology in practice because of cost of equipment,
         training staff new skills and interpretation and the increasing strain of various other diseases, which have
         higher mortality rates such as Cardiovascular disease, cancer and Diabetes, which are at the forefront of
         research and implementation into hospitals. It may be possibly years before a change is seen in this area.
