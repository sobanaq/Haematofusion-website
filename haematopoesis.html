    <h2 class="title">Haematopoesis</h2>


    <h2>Haematopoiesis</h2>
    Blood cells are formed by a process known as haematopoiesis, which occurs in the spongy bone marrow (figureure.1).
    During processes such as disease, overstimulation of the bone marrow, severe bone marrow failure & extensive tissue
    damage, the bone marrow can become overwhelmed; therefore disrupting blood cell differentiation and maturation. In
    this instance, other organs such as the spleen and liver are able to take over this function; this is known as
    extramedullary haematopoiesis. Shorten?

    <h2>Granulopoiesis</h2>
    Granulopoieisis refers to the process in which granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) are formed. It
    is controlled by a complex set of transcription factors (figure.1) which regulate expression of growth factors,
    their receptors, enzymes and adhesion molecules. In early granulopoiesis transcription factors C/EBPα / PU.1 / CBF
    and c-Myb interact with each other to express particular granulocytic lineage. It is thought G-CSF-R receptor
    signals C/EBPα gene induction in immature cells. C/EBPα in turn induces PU.1 in conjunction with CBF and c-Myb.
    G-CSF-R progresses the cell cycle with STAT5 and c-Myc (Ward et al., 2000).
    <p>Neutrophils are the most abundant leucocytes and plays a key role in elimination of bacteria and fungi.
        Progenitor cells, myeloblasts, promyelocytes and myelocytes form the mitotic pool in the bone marrow which do
        not appear in the peripheral blood (figure.2). The post mitotic phase forms the bone marrow reserve, which has a
        transit time of 4-6 days. It consists of metamyelocytes, band and segmented neutrophils (Summers et al., 2010;
        Tak et al., 2013).
    </p>
    <p>Eosinophils are the second most abundant leucocyte in the human body with 0.04-0.4x109/L cells in normal
        parameters. They are responsible for protection against parasites and play a role in inflammation, local
        immunity and tissue repair (Hoffbrand and Moss, 2016; Mescher, 2015). Eosinophilopoiesis occurs in the presence
        of IL-1, IL-3 and IL-5 (figure.1). Transcription factors GATA-1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and PU.1 commit
        HSC to eosinophils in the early stages, while GATA-1 in low levels remains to complete differentiation and
        maturation to mature eosinophils (figure.3). GATA-2 and C/EBPα also play a role in eosinophil lineage but it is
        not clear to what capacity (Uhm, Kim and Chung, 2012).
    </p>
    <p>Basophils are the least common leucocyte accounting for less than 1% total white cell count in the peripheral
        blood. They play a key role in hypersensitivity 1 reactions such asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergies. This
        is due to IgE receptors present on the cell surface that bind to allergens, which release inflammatory mediators
        and histamine (Hoffbrand et al., 2016; Buckland, 2018). The exact signalling events in how early progenitor
        cells commit to basophils is unclear (Siracusa et al., 2010). It is thought monocyte precursors promote
        eosinophil, mast and basophil precursors. This is through downregulating C/EBPα expression and upregulating
        GATA-2 expression. C/EBPα then upregulates again and the initiation of IL-4 and IL-13 maintained through
        development allows this maturation (figure.2) (Gauvreau, Ellis and Denburg, 2009; Siracusa et al., 2010)
    </p>
    <p>The function of monocytes is to protect from bacteria and fungi. They are much larger than other leucocytes at
        12-20µm in diameter. They circulate into the blood stream for 20-40 hours, eventually maturing in tissues and
        giving rise to macrophages and dendritic cells. Macrophage DC precursor (MDP) expresses CSF-1R, M-CSFR,CX3CR1
        and Flt3 giving rise to monocyte and macrophage subsets. PU.1 transcription factor allows monocyte
        differentiation by antagonizing C/EBPα, GATA-1, GATA-2 and activation interferon factor 8, Kruppel like factor 4
        (KLF-4) and early growth protein (Erg-1) (Mitchell, Roediger and Weninger, 2014; Terry and Miller, 2014).

    <h2>Erythropoiesis</h2>
    Erythropoiesis is a process in which erythrocytes are formed. Erythrocytes have a lifespan of 120 days. They are the
    most abundant blood cell, which are responsible for carrying oxygen (O2) around the body and carbon dioxide (CO2)
    back to the lungs. Erythropoiesis is regulated by the hormone erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is induced by lack of O2 in
    the kidneys thereby inducing hypoxial factors HIF-1α & HIF-1β. Simultaneously, EPO initiates GATA-2 to stimulate
    HSC’s to begin differentiation. GATA-1 & FOG1 enhance expression of BFUE & CFUE stages. CFUE proliferate & produce
    haemoglobin with growth factors IL-1, IL-3, SCF & glucocorticosteroids (Jelkmann, 2011; Higgins, 2015). Subsequently
    this allows erythrocytes to develop through the stages from pronormoblasts to mature red blood cells (figure.3). As
    haemoglobin levels increase rapidly, there is an increased uptake of O2 which is delivered to the tissues thus
    decreasing levels of EPO (Ohana et al., 2013).
