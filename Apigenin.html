    <h3>The benefits of flavonoids; in particular Apigenin</h3>
    <p>Plant derived extracts have been studied and used for their medicinal properties since the Ancient Egyptian
        period. In early Science, plant extracts were thought to cure a range of diseases with the addition of ritual
        practices such as ‘magic’.
        Throughout the centuries, Science has evolved where scientists now know that it is chemicals within plant
        extracts that have an effect on the organism, and not plants extracts alongside the superstition of magical
        rituals. This has come about from trial
        and error judgments on animals and humans subjects to the study of specific chemicals using high tech
        technologies, methods and statistical analysis backed by years of research today. (Parkins, 2001)
        Plant extracts contain chemicals such as vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to name a few. Phenolics are
        classed as antioxidants and are involved with providing protection for the plant, such as UV protection,
        antimicrobial, antiseptic,
        anti-cancerous and disease deflecting properties (Graham et al, 2003). Phenolics have derivatives including
        Tannins and Flavonoids, which have the same structural backbone consisting of one or two phenolic groups and are
        amongst the most widely,
        researched secondary metabolite due to their easy synthesis.</p>

    <h4>Flavonoids</h4>
    <p>First referred to as vitamin P and discovered by Hungarian physiologist Albert Szent-Györgyi in the mid 1930s.
        Flavonoids were thought to help metabolise vitamin C and that a vitamin P and C deficiency
        combined led to scurvy (Szent-Györgyi, 1938). Since then however the name vitamin P has gradually been replaced
        with the more acceptable flavonoids. This is probably due to the fact that according to The Oxford Dictionary a
        vitamin is:
    </p>
    <p>‘…any group of compounds which are essential for normal growth and nutrition and are required in small quantities
        in the diet because they cannot be synthesised by the body.’
        (Oxford University Press, 2012)</p>
    <p>Flavonoids therefore cannot be referred to as a vitamin even though they may be beneficial in the diet, because
        simply put, they are not essential. Flavonoids are in fact plant pigments that are polyphenol compounds,
        these pigmentations help protect plants from insects and microorganisms.
    </p>
    <p>They are found in fruits, vegetables, herbs, some grains and chocolate. Flavonoids have been used in traditional
        herbal remedies for thousands of years in eastern countries.
        Flavonoids have been found to have many beneficial effects on health such as anti-inflammatory, anti-viral and
        anti-bacterial properties (Hoorn et al. 2001) as well as preventing cell proliferation (Cook and Samman. 1996),
        anti-platelet aggregation and anti-thrombogenic effects (Middleton et al. 2000) amongst many others.
        Flavonoids are subdivided into groups of flavonols, flavonones, flavones, isoflavones and anthocyanidins
        depending on their chemical structure.
        Flavones are yellows pigments that can be found in cereals and herbs (Cermak & Wolffram,2006). Over 700 flavones
        have been identified (Renée and Williams, 2004) and of which Apigenin is an interesting substance.
    </p>
    <p>Apigenin is a crystalline with molecular formula C15H10O5 and a melting point of 345-350˚c. First mentioned as a
        ‘gelatinous substance’ after cooling (Rump,1836), and later coined as ‘Apigenin’ when it was crystallised from
        parsley
        glycosides by Lindenborn who thought it was a chemical (Tipson and Wolfrom, 1968). The western diet consists of
        20-50mg of flavonoids daily through a variety of foods eaten (Cermak & Wolffram,2006).
        Apigenin has been shown to act as an inhibitor on the protein cytochrome P4502C9 (Fawcett et al. 2009).
        Cytochrome P4502C9 is an enzyme found in the liver that metabolises many pharmaceutical drugs. It has also been
        to shown to reverse
        the effects of immunosuppressive drug Cyclosporine (Chong et al. 2009). In a more recent study by Mule et al
        (2009) the mechanism of action on gastric relaxation has found that gastric myorelaxant effects of Apigenin
        arose from negative
        modulation of an influx of calcium through voltage dependant Ca2+ channels.

    <h4>Organisation of the gut</h4>
    <p>The gut also known as the gastrointestinal tract consists of a tube that is 10 metres in length running from the
        mouth to the anus. It consists of a series of organs that help digest food therefore having a problem in any one
        of
        these can result in serious diseases. The gut is organised starting from the mouth where food it chewed in small
        bits, enough to swallow down the oesophagus. Next comes the stomach where it breaks down even further turning it
        into chyme
        and killing off any microorganisms with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Once in chyme form, it enters the small
        intestine first where a variety of juices such as bile and pancreatic enzymes break it down further in simpler
        form of
        lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, water and waste. The small intestine has villi covering its
        wall, thus increasing surface area, which allows maximum absorption of these nutrients. Next comes the large
        intestine,
        which absorbs remaining water and minerals and where bacteria break down waste material moving the waste towards
        the rectum. By now the waste material has reached the end of the gut tube, and the final sphincter of the anus
        muscle is
        voluntary whereby it is controlled by the organism of when it wants to open its bowels and empty the contents.
    </p>
    <h4>Smooth muscle</h4>
    <p>Smooth muscle is an involuntary muscle in that it cannot be stopped voluntarily; it is under the control of the
        autonomic nervous system. It is found in the walls of organs such as intestine, uterus, eye, urethra and blood
        vessels.
        Smooth muscle is made up of thick and think filaments (myosin and actin respectively) which are placed near the
        plasma membrane. The myosin and actin mediate by crosslinking thereby producing a contraction.
        This contraction is regulated by hormones and nerves. Contractions are initiated by an influx of calcium known
        as phosphorylation; this however differs to that of striated muscle in that calcium binds to myosin and not to
        troponin.
    </p>
    <h4>Gastrointestinal Disorders</h4>
    <p>Gastrointestinal disorders affect 1 in 5 people in the United Kingdom alone. The main causes of these disorders
        are infections from microorganisms, which if left to exacerbate can cause cancer of any gastric organ. General
        symptoms of gastric illness include pain, inflammation, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, heartburn and loss of
        appetite (NHS, 2012).
        An example of a popular microorganism that affects the intestines is the gram-negative bacteria
        Helicobacter.pylori (H.pylori). It affects 1 in 3 people every year (HPA, 2012). H.pylori is a commensal
        bacterium that is part of the body’s normal flora in the gut. It lives on the mucosal lining of the intestine.
        H.pylori is classed as an opportunistic pathogen in that it can affect the host if it gets passed the mucosal
        layer. If this
        happens, the immune system fires a response but cannot get past the stomach, as the concentrated gastric juices
        kill them off. However, the immune response does not give up and keeps sending killer cells. This overburden of
        immune cells causes the inflammation of the lining, which if left can lead to gastric ulcers (Helicobacter
        Foundation, 2006). As with all gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane of H.pylori is made up of
        lipopolysaccharides which induces a strong immune response by their host.
        As the effects of Apigenin on microbial and anti-inflammatory effects have been observed, studying the
        vasorelaxant effects of on ileum could help sufferers of gastro related disorders, as Apigenin maybe a potential
        for a new therapeutic drug that could help ease the symptoms associated with gastric disorders.
