    <h3 class="title">Sysmex XN9000</h3>

    <p>Sysmex analysers rely on the impedance model that relies on the fact that red blood cells and platelets are poor
        conductors of electricity, and certain diluents are good conductors of electricity. 88µl of blood to a pre-set
        amount of sheath fluid is aspirated of which a defined amount is sent to the detection chamber (DC) and passed
        through an aperture or small opening by a process known as hydrodynamic focussing. Electrodes are placed on each
        side of the aperture of which a direct current is passed. The direct current resistance between the electrodes
        changes as blood cells suspended in the diluent pass through the aperture. This resistance causes an electrical
        pulse which is proportional to the size of the blood cell. This data is is then converted into a graphical
        display of histograms or cytograms for ease of reading by the operator.

        Next the sample haemoglobin is detected using a cyanide-free sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). The sulfolyser
        reagent lyses red blood cells and white blood cells in the sample. The chemical reaction begins by altering the
        globin and then oxidising the haem group. Now the SLS hydrophilic groups can bind to the haem group and form a
        stable, coloured complex (SLS-Hb), which is analysed using a photometric method. An LED sends out monochromatic
        light and by moving through the mixture light is absorbed by the SLS-Hb complexes. The absorbance is measured by
        a photo sensor and is proportional to the haemoglobin concentration of the sample that is measured at light
        absorbance of 555 nM. Absorption photometric methods are usually influenced by the turbidity of the sample
        itself. In blood samples, turbidity can be caused due to lipaemia or leucocytosis. By using the SLS-Hb method
        these interferences can be minimised due to the effect of the reagent. A blank diluent sample is performed prior
        to each Hb analysis
        The sample is then transported into the flow cell. The sample is illuminated by a semiconductor laser beam,
        which can separate the cells using three different signals forward-scattered light (FSC), side-scattered light
        (SSC), side-fluorescence light (SFL) in the following form:

    <p>The intensity of the forward scatter indicates the cell volume. The side scatter provides information about the
        cell content, such as nucleus and granules. The side fluorescence indicates the amount of DNA and RNA present in
        the cell. Cells with similar physical and chemical properties form a cluster in a graph known as a scattergram.
    </p>

    <p>flow cytometric method measures cells in various channels including WNR, WDF, PLT –F, WPC, RET and BF modes.</p>

    <h4>WNR mode</h4>
    In a two-stage reaction, the cell membrane of the white blood cells is perforated in the first stage, during which
    the cells remain largely intact.
    In the second stage, the nucleic acids in the cells are labelled with a special fluorescence marker.
    The cell membrane of nucleated red blood cells (NRBC) is completely lysed and only their nuclei are labelled.
    In the scattergram, the cells are differentiated based on their fluorescence and size. Because fluorescence is now
    also used in the WNR channel,
    interferences from lipids and lyse-resistant RBC are reduced to a minimum.

    <p>
    <h4>WDF mode</h4>
    The WDF lysis reagent initially perforates the cell membranes while leaving the cells largely intact. Subsequently,
    intracellular DNA and RNA are labelled with a fluorescence marker.
    The improved formulation of the two new reagents results in a mild reaction, leaving most of the blood cell
    structure intact.
    As a result, even better separation is achieved, particularly of the lymphocytes and monocytes. In the scattergram,
    the cells are differentiated according to their fluorescence and internal structure. The intensity of the
    fluorescence signal is directly proportional to the
    nucleic acid content of the cell. Some of the strongest fluorescence signals are shown by immature and activated
    cells, due to their high RNA content.
    Therefore, these are successfully detected and can even be counted.

    <p>
    <h4>PLT–F mode</h4>
    In a two-stage reaction, the cell membranes of the platelets are first perforated, leaving the cells largely intact.
    Subsequently, the newly developed fluorescence marker specifically labels the platelets and in doing so almost
    completely masks interfering particles such as RBC fragments.
    The measured fluorescence signal is directly proportional to the degree of maturity of the platelets.

    <p><img src="Images/plt-f mode pic.JPG" alt="PLTmodePic" class="center"></p>

    <p>
    <h4>WPC mode</h4>
    The first stage of the reaction is affected by the composition of the cell membranes: the lysis reagent specifically
    affects lipids and therefore the lipid content of the
    cell membranes determines cell perforation. This affects the permeability of the membranes for the novel
    fluorescence marker that labels the cells in the second stage of the reaction.
    For example, the membranes of abnormal lymphocytes have a high lipid content and are therefore labelled to a greater
    extent than normal lymphocytes.
    This allows reliable differentiation of these two populations. In contrast, blasts show some of the lowest
    fluorescence signals due to their low membrane lipid content.
    Combining the information of cell size, intracellular complexity and fluorescence intensity also allows further
    differentiation and reliable identification of conspicuous
    cells like neoplastic lymphocytes (Abnormal Lympho? flag), which previously were difficult to distinguish from
    normal or reactive lymphocytes (Atypical Lympho? flag).
    In addition, large blasts can be reliably identified due to their combination of low fluorescence signal and a high
    forward-scattered signal (Blasts? flag).

    <p><img src="Images/wpc mode pic.JPG" alt="WPCmodePic" class="center"></p>

    <h4>RET mode</h4>
    The lysis reagent initially perforates the cell membranes while leaving the cells largely intact.
    In a second step, the fluorescence marker labels the intracellular nucleic acids and the resulting fluorescence
    signal is directly proportional to the nucleic acid content.
    Reticulocytes emit a higher fluorescence signal than mature red blood cells, which no longer contain RNA, and a
    considerably lower fluorescence signal than white blood cells.
    Since the RNA content decreases during the maturation process of the reticulocytes, one can determine three
    parameters that reflect these maturation stages:
    low fluorescence ratio (LFR), medium fluorescence ratio (MFR) and high fluorescence ratio (HFR).

    <p><img src="Images/ret mode.JPG" alt="RetmodePic" class="center"></p>

    <h4>BF mode</h4>
    The body fluid mode allows other fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, and ascetic fluid. No sample
    pre-preparation is
    necessary prior to sample analysis.
    While the RBCs are counted in the RBC channel using sheath flow impedance technology the WBC, mononuclear cells
    (MN)
    and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN)
    cells are determined by flow cytometry in the differential channel. The differential channel combines forward
    scatter (size of the cell) with side scatter
    (inner complexity of the cell) and the fluorescence intensity (DNA/RNA content) to identify and cluster each
    cell.
    This channel also measures high fluorescence body fluid cells (HF-BF), such as macrophages and mesothelial
    cells.
    These HF-BF cells are found just above the MN cluster at
    fluorescence discriminator > 200 channels, and are not included in the WBC (differential) count, but are
    included in
    the total nucleated cell count (TC-BF).
    If the number of HF-BF cells present exceeds a preset cutoff value, the “WBC abnormal scattergram” flag will be
    generated. This cut-off value is user-definable.
    Additionally, if non-cellular particles, such as bacteria or cell debris are present, leading to erroneous
    clusters,
    the “WBC abnormal scattergram” flag will be automatically
    generated.
